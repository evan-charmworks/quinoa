  \brief     Charm++ chare partitioner group used to perform mesh partitioning
  \details   Charm++ chare partitioner group used to perform mesh partitioning.

    The implementation uses the Charm++ runtime system and is fully
    asynchronous, overlapping computation, communication as well as I/O. The
    algorithm utilizes the structured dagger (SDAG) Charm++ functionality. The
    high-level overview of the algorithm structure and how it interfaces with
    Charm++ is discussed in the Charm++ interface file
    src/Inciter/partitioner.ci.

    #### Call graph ####
    The following is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that outlines the
    asynchronous algorithm implemented in this class The detailed discussion of
    the algorithm is given in the Charm++ interface file partitioner.ci,
    which also repeats the graph below using ASCII graphics. On the DAG orange
    fills denote global synchronization points, orange frames with white fill
    are partial synchronization points that overlap with other tasks, and dashed
    lines are potential shortcuts that allow jumping over some of the task-graph
    under some circumstances. See the detailed discussion in partitioner.ci.
